## Project Overview

Welcome to the AcmeTech Solutions Employee Attrition Analysis project repository. In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of employee attrition factors within AcmeTech Solutions, a prominent tech company. Our primary objective was to identify key drivers of attrition and provide actionable recommendations to reduce turnover rates. This README provides an overview of the project, its key features, and instructions for utilization.

### Purpose
AcmeTech Solutions, with approximately 4,000 employees, faces a 26% annual employee turnover rate. This high attrition rate has significant repercussions, including project delays and increased recruitment and training costs. Our project aimed to address these challenges by answering critical questions related to attrition and presenting data-driven insights to support decision-making.

### Key Questions Explored
- How many employees does the company have today?
- How many employees left the company last year?
- What is the percentage of employees who left the company last year?
- How many employees with low job satisfaction left the company last year?
- What is the percentage of employees with low job satisfaction who left the company?
- And more (see full list in the project scope).
